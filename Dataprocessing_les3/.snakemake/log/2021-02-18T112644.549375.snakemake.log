rule try:
    input: bioinf.nl/~fennaf/snakemake/test.txt
    output: test.txt

Error in rule try:
    jobid: 0
    output: test.txt
    shell:
        wget bioinf.nl/~fennaf/snakemake/test.txt
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
